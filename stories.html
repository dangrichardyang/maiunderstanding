                  <br>that they want to accomplish.
                  <br>But everytime I take that step,
                  <br>I always end up going back,
                  <br>there are those who stands in my way.

                  <p>On a snowy night, a little boy stopped and looked at the sky. "Wow", thought the boy, "I wonder if my family is thinking about me at all. Do they miss me? Will they look for me?" Just then he saw a girl who was crying next to him. He then asked, "Little girl, why are you crying?"</p>

                  <p>I thought that it was going to be finalized

                  <br>I thought we were going to be together.

                  <p>Dreams are only dreams and that's how I want it because the moment reality becomes a reality, the pain of not achieving my dreams would be a pain. "Strive hard to achieve that dream", many people may say, but look at the many who never achieves it instead.</p>

                  <p>As I open my eyes, I felt air rushing towards me. A mask that was pumping air to me fastens. As I began to slowly close my eyes again, I began to feel afraid as my family gets close out by the nurses and the door. Iâ€™m going to die.</p>
