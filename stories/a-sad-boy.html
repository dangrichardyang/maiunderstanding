      <h1>A Sad Boy</h1>
      <h2>November 19, 2011 at 4:18 PM</h2>
      <p>On a snowy night, a little boy stopped and looked at the sky. "Wow", thought the boy, "I wonder if my family is thinking about me at all. Do they miss me? Will they look for me?" Just then he saw a girl who was crying next to him. He then asked, "Little girl, why are you crying?"</p>
      <p>The little girl then said, "I cannot find my way home. I am lost. Not only that but I am cold and hungry."</p>
      <p>Hearing this, the little boy took the little girl's hand and they ran to a convience store. The little boy convinced the girl to steal some food for them. Hence, the girl hesitated and so one of the store worker saw them. They ran as fast as they could to the park.</p>
      <p>After they ate their warm meal, they had to go find a warm place to stay at. No matter where they went, the place did not welcome them. They decided to go back to the park to spend the night there. After awhile, the girl became very cold. She was shivering so bad that the boy had no idea what to do. He dedided that he will go and steal a person's blanket for the little girl's sake.</p>
      <p>When he came back, the little girl ask, "Where is your home little boy? Why aren't you looking for your house?"</p>
      <p>The boy replied softly, "I do not have a home to go to. I am alone. Will you stay with me forever and be my friend?"</p>
      <p>Seing the lonely boy's face, she could not say no. When the next day have arrived, they played until a policeman came to take the little girl with him. She couldn't leave the little boy alone so she told him to come with her. The policeman took her to her parents. When the girl Told them about the little boy that was with her the whole time and is standing by her, her parents said, "Honey, there is no one standing by you."</p>
