        <h2>August 26, 2015 at 9:16 PM</h2>
        <p>Dreams are only dreams and that's how I want it because the moment reality becomes a reality, the pain of not achieving my dreams would be a pain. "Strive hard to achieve that dream", many people may say, but look at the many who never achieves it instead. Then they'll say to focus on the ones who did achieve and keep working hard. There are many people with my same ideas and same logic and they may have achieve it, but my ambition is probably not high enough because all my life, I was taught to surrender and submit to the better ones. No matter how much I tried, I was never the chosen one and I grew accustomed to be the loser and give up. Each time that I tried and looked forward to something, it comes back and stabs me. No pain, no gain but I have yet to get a gain. Looking back, did I even try hard? Why did I always give up before the end? I can always learn from my mistakes.</p>
        <p>Prove to them that you can do so much more. When they talk bad about you, try not to fight back with just words or by being ignorant but by action of the future that you, too, can do the same as them. May be not now but look forward to the future while still alive. It's about time to stand up to yourself. It's about time to believe in yourself and not the words of others. Don't cloud your mind with fear or bad thoughts but remember the ones who are by your side and are supporting you. It's about time to make a change in your life</p>
