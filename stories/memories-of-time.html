      <h1>Memories of Time</h1>
      <h2>November 19, 2011 at 3:51 PM</h2>
      <p><q>This is not good, doctor</q>, I heard some say, <q>She is in a critical condition.</q></p>
      <p><q>Then we must operate. Hurry</q>, replied a man.</p>    
      <p>As I open my eyes, I felt air rushing towards me. A mask that was pumping air to me fastens. As I began to slowly close my eyes again, I began to feel afraid as my family gets close out by the nurses and the door. I’m going to die. Without even realizing it, flashbacks came forth. The most vivid one was so painful.</p>
      <p><q>I’m sorry dad. You had to cancel your work because of me</q>, I said.</p>          
      <p><q>Don’t worry. Daddy will do anything for his little angel</q>, said my dad.</p>
      <p><q>How are you feeling, hon</q>, ask my mother as she was making her way towards me.</p>
      <p><q>I’m fine. It’s just that I can’t sleep. I am so excited</q>, I told her.</p>          
      <p>Tomorrow is the day I turn 14. It is a very important day for me because it will be my first time going somewhere other than my house, school, and the hospital. It will also be my first time to put on make-up and look all girly. Because of my health condition, I was not allowed near any of them, but my doctor will allow it just for tomorrow. I am so happy.</p>         
      <p><q>You need your rest, baby sister</q>, said Sylvia.</p>             
      <p>Sylvia is 18 years old and is fill up with great knowledge. Jade is her middle name; she is a precious stone. She is like a stone that has gold to show off the color and make it worthy. I call her Silver since the name Jade doesn’t really match her as a name.</p>      
      <p><q>I know that, but I am afraid to sleep. I am afraid that if I go to sleep, I might never wake up ever again</q>, I said.</p>             
      <p><q>Alice. That will never happen to you. You can sleep now. We won’t let anything happen to you</q>, said my mother.</p>             
      <p>Alice is my middle name; my mother wanted that as my original one. My father didn’t like it but to make my mother feel better it became my middle name. My full name is Sophia Alice Monroe. I find it a weird name.</p>             
      <p>“Sophie can sleep with me. Tomorrow is the official day you become a young lady”, said Sylvia.</p>              
      <p><q>What are you saying Silver? I have always been a young lady</q>, I told her.</p>              
      <p><q>Right, like I will believe that. Come on</q>, said Sylvia.</p>              
      <p><q>No, I will sleep in here. You just watch my back if something happens</q>, I said.</p>              
      <p>Soon after my parents gave me their kisses on my forehead, they left. Then I study that beautiful light that was shining through my window. As I open it, the breeze of warmth and happiness overcame me. When I lay back in bed, I thought about the moon. As beautiful as it is, will it ever feel any loneliness? Being born but doesn’t disappear; it lives on and on. It has the stars and lights to be its friends. It must still feel lonely; after all, it holds everyone sadness.</p>               
      <p><q>Sophie! Sophie, wake up</q>, yelled Sylvia.</p>             
      <p><q>Huh? What’s going on</q>, I ask.</p>             
      <p><q>I don’t know but you were moaning ‘Help me, help me’ and so I woke you up. Are you okay</q>, ask Sylvia.</p> 
      <p><q>Yes. I’m fine</q>, I said. I was very unsure about that.</p>              
      <p><q>Okay then. Get ready and come downstairs. You are the star today</q>, she said and then left. I took a couple of deep breaths and then washed up. After I got dressed, I rushed downstairs to show off my beauty. By the time I reached the door to the family room, I heard someone other than my family. It is Doctor Eugene! He is the doctor in charge of me. He is 21 and often comes to my house to tutor my sister. She wants to save people, motivated by me.</p>              
      <p><q>So who is this beauty</q>, asked Eugene.</p>             
      <p><q>Beautiful, right? It was specially design for me</q>, I said proudly.</p>              
      <p>Just as I finish saying that, there was a ring at the door. I was about to open the door, but Sylvia got there first. It was Alex, my best friend who stands with me through thick and thin. Of course, I wasn’t surprise when he had an amazed look on his face. I also wasn’t surprise when my other friends didn’t show up. I don’t understand why but my friend, Susan, hated me; I just shrugged it off.</p>              
      <p>After what felt like hours, we finally arrived at the turn-of-the-century theme park. There were a lot of children running all over the places and lovers enjoying their time. There were a couple of other rides there but the one that caught everyone’s attention was the ride call High Roller. A lot of people screamed but at the same time excited. Of course, we went on it. Alex was afraid to go on it at first, so I had to drag him on it.</p>              
      <p>When Alex and I got back from what felt like our 100th time riding the High Roller, Sylvia and Eugene bought some food for us. They were telling us what each food was call but I just kept on eating. When I looked up, I saw a boy. He was quite chubby and had food crumbs and sauces all over his face and shirt. When I pointed him out, everyone was laughing.</p> 
      <p>After we finish eating, Alex and I explored the theme park. When we were going back to the group, I saw Susan. She was here with my other friends. I didn’t get it. She said she was busy today. I went up to her to set things straight until she said, <q>Why should we hang out with someone who is going to die like you? You have no use for us.</q></p>              
      <p>Alex was going to stop us, but I couldn’t leave it be. I yelled, <q>Why are you acting like this? I thought you were my best friend. Someone who I could trust.</q></p>             
      <p>She yelled back, <q>Well you thought wrong! That trust disappeared when you stole the person that I liked!</q></p>              
      <p><q>But Susan…</q></p>              
      <p><q>No excuses! Go away, you traitor! No one needs you! You are only in the way!</q></p>              
      <p>I was shocked; I couldn’t move. I looked up and saw Alex’s hand across Susan’s face. He yelled some things to her but I couldn’t hear. Alex dragged me all the way back to the group and to the car, not letting go of my hand. When I heard him whisper, <q>Don’t worry. You still have me</q>, I blacked out.</p>
