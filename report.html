      <h2>Richard Yang</h2>
      <h2>4/10/2020</h2>
      <p>1. You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business, a student group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be just you.</p>
      <p>- The client is a friend of mine.</p>
      <p>2. Your site must include some sort of header.</p>
      <p>- I have created a header that includes a quote, by my friend, the website logo, a menu button, and a navigation bar.</p>
      <p>3. Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose.</p>
      <p>- The navigation bar links to 5 pages and the stories page links to 8 other pages as well.</p>
      <p>4. Your site must include some sort of navigation links.</p>
      <p>- The navigation bar, Home page moving penguin image, Home page "click here" button, and the website logo all have navigation links to them.</p>
      <p>5. Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens. You are encouraged to implement separate layouts using CSS media queries.</p>
      <p>- This is best seen with the Stories page and Drawings page since they go from multicolumn to single layouts, but all pages are changed based on the display size.</p>
      <p>6. Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Global style rules must be placed in a shared stylesheet. Individual pages’ style rules must be placed in a separate stylesheets.</p>
      <p>- There is a style.css that all pages use for global style rules but each main page has their own css file. There is also a global stories-style.css file which all of the different stories share.</p>
      <p>7. Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.</p>
      <p>- All images have an alt attribute and they describe each image exactly as they are, I believe.</p>
      <p>8. Each page must declare its favicon.</p>
      <p>- All of the pages inslud the favicon.</p>
      <p>9. Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. JavaScript must be placed in a directory named js.</p>
      <p>- All of the correct files have been place in the correct areas. I created a seperate directory for all of the different stories to not confuse it with the main 5 pages.</p>
      <p>10. Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.</p>
      <p>- I do not believe I use any libraries.</p>
      <p>11. Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s HTML validator and CSS validator.</p>
      <p>- There are no warnings or errors.</p>
      <p>12. Your site must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, share with the user twodee.</p>
      <p>- The github repository is public. I have shared both the website link and github repository link with you.</p>
      <p>13. The names of your files should be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.</p>
      <p>- Aside from "-" all files are lowercase and alphanumeric.</p>
      <p>14. Your site must be served out of port 8443.</p>
      <p>- The site is on port 8443.</p>
      <p>15. Your site must be accessed only through HTTPS. You are encouraged to use Let’s Encrypt to obtain a free certificate.</p>
      <p>- Site is accessible through HTTPS.</p>
      <p>16. Your content should be neatly aligned. The axes should be clearly visible.</p>
      <p>- I believe it's neatly aligned</p>
      <p>17. Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and copy in a serif font.</p>
      <p>- There are 2 font faces throughout the website.</p>
      <p>18. Your site must include at least one form (or informal collection of input elements). The form might submit data to a server or invoke some client-side JavaScript function that alters the page. The action is not specified.</p>
      <p>- There is a Javascript button on the Homepage that takes you to the newest story upon click.</p>
      <p>19. Your site must include links to external sites. Clicking on external links must open a new tab or window rather than replace your page.</p>
      <p>- The social media icons at the bottom and on the Social page open up new tabs to external websites (facebook, twitter, and instagram).</p>
      <p>20. Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs.</p>
      <p>- I hope that it is. I tried my best to make it presentable and readable.</p>
      <p>21. Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or JavaScript.</p>
      <p>- The homepage has an animation of a walking/ waddling penguin through CSS.</p>

      <h1>Client Critique</h1>
      <h2>Client: Mai See Xiong</h2>
      <h2>04/10/2020</h2>
      <p>I really enjoy Mai Understanding. I never had the time to think about a website before, so I didn’t know what I wanted. Richard helped me through the process and for sure, I didn’t want to leave any penguins out of it. At first, it was going to be bright colors like pink and green, but it would’ve been unattracted. So, I thought plain would do the job, but for sure, I still wanted to go through with penguin themed colors which wasn’t much, but I think the website was done well to highlight the colors.</p>
      <p>Currently, it’s full of my older unprofessional works because it was so sudden, but if I do choose to use this website in the future, it will definitely have more works and more organized in the genre. For sure, I wanted the homepage to be able to let the visitors to go to the latest story or reading. I wonder if it will be automatically or if the creator of the website have to link it somehow.</p>
      <p>For the “stories” page, there’s a photo that somehow connected to each story. I also like the enlargement of each story, too, when the cursor is over it. Because I don’t have any idea how website works, I do wonder how I can add in new works. Currently, the stories are organized alphabetically, but for future works, I would like it to be organized by date. Not only that, but I am still wondering about the whether the tab should include the story titles so that it would be easy to navigate. This is, of course, my personal preference still on pend.</p>
      <p>The “drawings” page, similar to the stories page, also pops up, but without the borders and the color changes which is fine because I think the highlighting of it would’ve been distracting. I like that when a picture is selected, it can be exit out. The only concern I have is that the enlarge photo isn’t bigger than the image itself.</p>
      <p>The about page and the social media page also doesn’t disappoint, but there’s nothing uploaded on the medias because they were made for the purpose of the assignment. Other minor detail is the penguin logo on the website tab. I was surprised that it was included. I had forgotten about it. Overall, I’ve seen the struggles and the hard work that Richard had done for this assignment. This includes going beyond at some point. I enjoyed working with Richard on this assignment.</p>
